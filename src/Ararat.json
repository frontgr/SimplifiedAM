    "Ararat": "Mount Ararat (/ˈærəræt/, ARR-ə-rat; Armenian: Արարատ, romanized: Ararat; Kurdish: Çiyayê Ararat), also known as Mount Ağrı (Turkish: Ağrı Dağı; Kurdish: Çiyayê Agirî) or Masis (Armenian: Մասիս), is a snow-capped and dormant compound volcano in the extreme east of Turkey. It consists of two major volcanic cones: Greater Ararat and Little Ararat. Greater Ararat is the highest peak in Turkey and the Armenian Highland with an elevation of 5,137 m (16,854 ft); Little Ararat's elevation is 3,896 m (12,782 ft).[4] The Ararat massif is about 35 km (22 mi) wide at ground base.[5] The first recorded efforts to reach Ararat's summit were made in the Middle Ages, and Friedrich Parrot, Khachatur Abovian, and four others made the first recorded ascent in 1829."
